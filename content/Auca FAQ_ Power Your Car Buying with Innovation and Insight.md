Auca brings the entire UK auction market to your fingertips. With custom filters, evaluation tools, and proxy bidding, you can find the right vehicles faster and make informed decisions.

# Getting Started {#getting-started}

## How do I sign up for Auca? {#how-do-i-sign-up-for-auca?}

Signing up is quick and self-serve\! Visit our website, enter your company details, and choose a subscription: £149/month (ex VAT) for a single user, with additional users at £99/month (ex VAT). Pay via card, direct debit, or contact us for corporate terms. Once your payment is confirmed, you’ll get instant access to start exploring thousands of vehicles.

## What do I need to bid on vehicles? {#what-do-i-need-to-bid-on-vehicles?}

To bid, you must be a member of at least one auction house partnered with Auca. This membership allows you to move vehicles from the Inbox Lane to the Evaluate and Bid Lanes. If you’re not a member of an auction house, you can apply to join directly through Auca. Auction houses handle their own vetting, ensuring you meet their eligibility criteria (e.g., trade licenses).

## Can I try Auca before committing? {#can-i-try-auca-before-committing?}

Auca operates on a flexible subscription model with no free trial, but you can cancel anytime and retain access until the end of your paid month. We’re confident that Auca’s value will shine through from day one. Keep an eye out for future promotions or demos\!

## What happens if I cancel my subscription? {#what-happens-if-i-cancel-my-subscription?}

No strings attached\! If you cancel, you’ll keep full access to Auca until the end of the month you’ve paid for (e.g., cancel in mid-March, use Auca until March 31). Manage cancellations easily in the Billing section of your Auca Accounts page.

# Using Auca {#using-auca}

## How does Auca’s search and filtering work? {#how-does-auca’s-search-and-filtering-work?}

Auca’s search is your shortcut to the perfect vehicle. Create custom filters based on criteria like vehicle type (e.g., hatchback, van), transmission, age, mileage, estimated value, and more—tailored to your buying strategy. Your Inbox Lane auto-populates with vehicles from our partnered auction houses that match your filters. Set up multiple filter profiles for different needs and apply secondary filters (e.g., vehicles with images or in specific locations) for extra precision.

## What are the Inbox, Evaluate, and Bid Lanes? {#what-are-the-inbox,-evaluate,-and-bid-lanes?}

These lanes guide your workflow like a well-oiled machine:

* **Inbox Lane**: Your starting point, filled with vehicles matching your filters from our variety of auction houses.  
* **Evaluate Lane**: Move vehicles here for deeper analysis. You must be a member of the auction house selling the vehicle. Run MotorCheck Condition Reports (£1 ex VAT, billed with your subscription), view Auction House reports, and assess the vehicle’s potential.  
* **Bid Lane**: Ready to act? Place, update, or cancel proxy bids directly with the auction house. Post-auction, Auca auto-updates the bid status, showing if you won, lost, or the sale price if you didn’t win.

## How do I join an auction house through Auca? {#how-do-i-join-an-auction-house-through-auca?}

Spot a vehicle from an auction house you’re not a member of? No problem. From the Inbox Lane, select the vehicle and follow Auca’s prompts to apply for membership with that auction house. Once approved, you can move the vehicle to the Evaluate Lane and start bidding.

## What reports can I access for vehicle evaluation? {#what-reports-can-i-access-for-vehicle-evaluation?}

Auca integrates with MotorCheck to provide:

* **Condition Reports**: £1 ex VAT per report, added to your next monthly invoice.  
* **Service History and Specification Checks**: Run these using your MotorCheck Membership Token under your own MotorCheck account. Charges are billed directly by MotorCheck at your agreed rate, with no Auca fees.  
  You can also view Auction House reports in the Evaluate Lane for a complete picture.

## How does proxy bidding work on Auca? {#how-does-proxy-bidding-work-on-auca?}

In the Bid Lane, place a proxy bid by setting your maximum offer, which Auca submits directly to the auction house. You can update or cancel the bid anytime before the auction ends. After the auction, Auca automatically updates the bid status, showing if you won, lost, or the final sale price. It’s hassle-free and keeps you informed.

## What bidding analytics does Auca offer? {#what-bidding-analytics-does-auca-offer?}

Auca tracks your bidding activity, letting you analyze how your proxy bids compare to sale prices, broken down by auction house and vehicle type. This insight helps you refine your strategy and spot opportunities. Exciting news: our next major release in late summer 2025 will introduce advanced Business Intelligence Reports for even deeper performance tracking\!

## Which auction houses does Auca work with? {#which-auction-houses-does-auca-work-with?}
